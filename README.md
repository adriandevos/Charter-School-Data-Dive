# Charter-School-Data-Dive
This is an exploratory analysis of an unnamed charter school system. It was originally assigned to me on 8/1/2020. 
The goal of this project was to understand how different students performed on an interim math assessment in 2016 and 2017.

I'm hoping to understand which types of students demonstrated proficiency, and also which grade levels and school sites demonstrated proficiency. 
Additionally, I'm hoping to discover a relationship between prior school performance and overall growth. 

My analysis will progress as followed:

##Dataset Scrub
*Ensure student data is HIPAA compliant 
*Check for inconsistencies with student IDs 
*Eliminate observations of groups with sample size <10
*Rename columns for easier reading

##Visualizations of Data
*Histograms to understand score proficiencies |Categorized Bar Graphs 
  
##Multivariate Regression
*Understand which categorical variables contribute to academic proficiency
